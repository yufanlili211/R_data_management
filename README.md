This R data management practice project is from "Introductory course in programming in Python and R in life sciences HT2024" teaching by Maria Kjellsson and Wesley Schaal (Uppsala University).

## 1. Contents of the R practice project
   - **data management:** dplyr, tidyr
   - **basic graphical exploration:** ggplot2
   - **initial statistical analysis:** t test, anova
  
## 2. Datasets
   - BPI889_PD_run-in.csv (Run-in data is from the phase 2b study of BPI889)
   - BPI889_demographics.tab (Covariates)

## 3. Frame story
You are working as a modelling scientist in the DMPK (Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics) group at Big Pharma Inc. BPI889, a follow-up compound to indinavir, is under development as treatment against HIV/AIDS. You will perform the data management, basic graphical exploration and an initial statistical analysis on the run-in data from the phase IIb study.

The phase IIb study focuses on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BPI889 with CD4 lymphocyte count used as a biomarker in HIV-positive patients. The design was double-blinded, randomised, parallel study with four arms: 200 mg, 400 mg and 800 mg of study drug (BPI889) and a comparator. Study duration was 20 weeks with active treatment, preceded by a run-in period of 2 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was time to recovery (TTR) which is defined as the time from start of treatment until reaching a CD4 count >500 cells/mm3. The dose response is to be defined based on TTR and relative to the comparator.

You will however be working on the run-in data, hence no drug is given and only the behaviour of the natural progression of the disease (in terms of the biomarkers) is investigated. Apart from the CD4 count, you are also provided with demographic information for the enrolled individuals.
